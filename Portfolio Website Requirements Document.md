Thank you for uploading your resume. Based on the content of your resume, I have generated a structured and refined **requirement specification document** for Lovable App to build a static portfolio website.

# 📘 Portfolio Website Requirements Document

**Project Title**: Cloud Portfolio Resume Website
**Technology Stack**: ReactJS + JSON (Static Site), Hosted on GitHub Pages

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a **static portfolio website** using **ReactJS**, automatically generated by Lovable App from an uploaded resume. The website should:

* Closely **mimic the formatting and structure of a Word document**
* Be fully static and **hostable on GitHub Pages**
* Dynamically fetch content from **JSON files**, generated by parsing the resume
* Be **visually identical** to a professional resume for readability and consistency

---

## 📤 Resume Upload & Data Extraction

* Prompt user to **upload a resume** (`.pdf` or `.docx`).
* Once uploaded, Lovable App will:

  * **Scan and parse** the resume content
  * Break down the content into **distinct sections** such as:

    * Personal Info
    * Summary
    * Technical Skills
    * Education
    * Certifications
    * Work Experience
    * Projects (if any)
    * Additional Info
  * Generate one **JSON file per section**.

---

## 🗂️ Application Folder Structure

Each section will correspond to a **folder** within the web application.
For example:

```
src/
├── personal-info/
│   └── personal-info.json
├── summary/
│   └── summary.json
├── skills/
│   └── skills.json
├── education/
│   └── education.json
├── certifications/
│   └── certifications.json
├── experience/
│   └── experience.json
...
```

Each React component will:

* Fetch data from its respective JSON file
* Render the section with formatting similar to a Word resume

---

## 🎨 Design & UI Requirements

* The **visual styling** must replicate the original resume formatting as closely as possible:

  * Fonts, spacing, layout, margins
  * Section headers with bolding/underline as applicable
  * Bullet points for responsibilities/skills
* Use **print-friendly CSS** so that users can also print or save the site as a PDF
* Mobile-responsive if possible

---

## 🌐 Hosting & Deployment

* The entire portfolio site should be static:

  * No server-side rendering or databases
  * All data is stored as **JSON files**
* Deploy to **GitHub Pages**
* Site should be immediately visible by visiting the GitHub Pages URL
* When JSON files are updated, the UI should reflect the changes dynamically upon rebuild

---

## 🔁 Future Enhancements (Optional)

* Ability to **edit JSON files** via a simple admin form (can be added later)
* Switch between **multiple resume templates**
* Add **dark mode/light mode toggle**

---

## ✅ Next Steps

**✅ Resume uploaded:** `Sri-AWS-Java-Cloud-Development-FullStackEngineer-June2025.pdf`
Parsed sections identified:

1. Personal Information
2. Professional Summary
3. Technical Skills
4. Education
5. Certifications
6. Work Experience (multiple projects)
7. Optional: Add projects as a separate section

Would you like me to generate the initial JSON files for each section based on the uploaded resume?

If yes, I’ll begin extracting and formatting each section accordingly.
