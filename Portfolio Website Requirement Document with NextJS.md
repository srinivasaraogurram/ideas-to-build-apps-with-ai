Here is a refined and well-organized version of your requirement document, suitable for providing to a tool like Lovable or for team development. I've improved grammar, structure, and clarity:

# 📄 Portfolio Website Requirement Document with NextJS

## 🎯 Objective

To create a **static, resume-style portfolio website** using **Next.js** (React-based framework) that closely resembles a Word document in appearance. The goal is to host this website on **GitHub Pages**, with a dynamic and maintainable structure powered by **JSON-based content**.

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### 1. 📄 Resume Upload & Parsing

* The application should prompt the user to **upload a resume** (in `.pdf` or `.docx` format).
* Once uploaded, the app should **parse** the resume into different **logical sections** (e.g., Education, Work Experience, Skills, Projects).
* Each section will be used to generate content in a **structured JSON format**.

### 2. 📁 Folder-Based Structure

* Each resume section (e.g., `education`, `experience`, `projects`, `skills`) will be represented as a **separate folder** in the web application.
* Each folder will contain a corresponding **JSON file** (e.g., `education.json`, `experience.json`) holding that section's data.

### 3. 🧾 Data Representation

* Resume content will be **stored in JSON files**, ensuring easy updates and future migration to a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL).
* The application will **dynamically fetch** and render content from these JSON files at runtime.

### 4. 💻 Frontend Requirements

* Framework: **Next.js** (preferred for static generation and routing).
* The website should **visually resemble a Microsoft Word document**:

  * Fonts, layout, and spacing should emulate the resume format.
  * Responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.

### 5. 🌐 Static Site Deployment

* The site must be **statically generated** and suitable for hosting on **GitHub Pages**.
* Content updates via JSON should reflect automatically after site rebuild (using CI/CD or manual triggers).

### 6. 🖱️ User Experience

* When visiting the portfolio URL, the user should experience a layout **identical to reading a resume in Word**.
* Clean, professional UI with consistent styling and section navigation.

1. Parse the document into structured sections.
2. Generate corresponding JSON files.
3. Scaffold a Next.js project structure based on the extracted sections.

Please upload your resume now to begin.

Would you like me to scaffold the folder and JSON file structure after the upload?
